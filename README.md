Note:

    Fans of the television series have identified the fonts used by Samaritan
    as "Magda Clean Mono Regular" and "Magda Clean Mono Bold".

    However, to ensure there are no licensing encumberments, this repository
    does not include non-free fonts. We will not accept any pull requests to
    include such fonts.
